## GAMERRPG   POLICE BACKUP ##

EDITED BY Gamer RPG

This script is a free QBCORE version of Police Backup.

This script was based on:

https://github.com/FAXES/Police-Backup

AND

https://github.com/FAXES/Police-Backup/tree/ESXmaster

When you enter the server you will have to type "/cp" to check if you are a police officer or not.

It's my first script and it's pretty basic.

I DID NOT TAKE MULTIPLAYER TESTS

If you detect errors, just mention it on my discord.

It was created by GamerRPG if you need support just enter my DISCORD :)
